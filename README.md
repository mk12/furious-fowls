# Furious Fowls

Furious Fowls is a web game inspired by Angry Birds, built with [TypeScript], [p5.js], and [box2d.js].

I originally wrote Furious Fowls in my ICS2O high school class using [Processing] and [fisica]. This repository is my rewrite of that ten years later.

## Gameplay

Win this innovative game by catapulting red birds into the makeshift shelters protecting green pigs. The level is cleared once each pig has gone _Poof!_

There are 8 built-in levels and 3 slots for creating custom levels with the level editor. If you beat all 8 levels with one shot each, it unlocks a secret capability.
