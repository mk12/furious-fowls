# Furious Fowls

Furious Fowls is a web game inspired by Angry Birds, built with [TypeScript], [p5.js], and [box2d.js].

I originally wrote Furious Fowls in my grade 10 computer science class (ICS2O) class using [Processing] and [fisica]. This repository is my rewrite of the game ten years later for the web.

## Usage

To play the game, visit https://mk12.github.io/furious-fowls.

To hack on the game, run `npm install`, and then:

- `npm run dev` to serve the app with auto-rebuild.
- `npm run build` to build an optimized app bundle.
- `npm run tc` to typecheck the code.
- `npm run lint` to lint the code.
- `npm run fmt` to format the code.

## Gameplay

Win this innovative game by catapulting red birds into green pigs, making them go _Poof!_

Beat all 8 levels in one shot each to unlock a secret capability!

Design your own levels in the level editor!
